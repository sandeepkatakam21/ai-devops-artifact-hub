# ai-devops-artifact-hub

Repository template for managing hybrid traditional code and generative AI prompt/model artifacts in DevOps workflows. Includes orchestration for hybrid pipelines, prompt/version management, and secure DevSecOps guidance for AI.

## Overview

ai-devops-artifact-hub is a starter template that treats prompts, model configs, evaluation datasets, and agents as first-class artifacts alongside application code. It provides a structure and guidance for:
- Hybrid pipelines that combine traditional CI/CD with LLMOps/ModelOps stages
- Prompt, dataset, and model versioning with clear provenance
- Automated evaluations, safety checks, and drift monitoring
- Secure-by-default DevSecOps for AI workloads
- Governance, auditability, and reproducibility

Repo layout (suggested):
- /apps/ — application services, infra as code
- /ai/
  - /prompts/ — prompt libraries (YAML/Markdown)
  - /models/ — model cards, configs, adapters/LoRA
  - /datasets/ — eval sets, red-teaming corpora, data sheets
  - /evaluations/ — metrics, tests, harness definitions
  - /agents/ — orchestrations, tools, guardrails
- /pipelines/ — CI/CD + LLMOps workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- /security/ — threat models, SBOM, policies
- /docs/ — runbooks, ADRs

## Pipeline examples

1) Hybrid CI + Prompt/Model Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Trigger: PR to main touching /ai/** or /apps/**
- Jobs:
  - build_test: build app, unit/integration tests, SCA/SAST
  - prompt_lint: validate prompt YAML/MD schema; check anti-patterns (leaks, identity)
  - model_eval: spin up eval harness; run golden tests and regression metrics
  - safety_checks: toxicity, jailbreak, PII, license and content filtering
  - drift_check: compare eval score deltas vs baseline, flag regression
  - artifact_pack: package prompts, configs, adapters, eval results as a release asset
  - deploy_canary: deploy behind feature flag; enable shadow or A/B traffic

2) Scheduled AI Governance Job
- Nightly: refresh evals on latest data slices; rotate red-team prompts; generate scorecards
- Weekly: produce AI SBOM, model lineage graph, and risk report to /security/reports

3) Promotion Gate
- Require: minimum eval score thresholds; safety badges pass; approvals from AI risk codeowners
- Auto-tag: prompts vX.Y.Z, dataset vA.B, model config vC.D with immutable release notes

## Best practices: prompt and model management

Prompt management
- Treat prompts as code: review, lint, test, and version tag
- Structure: use YAML with metadata (owner, task, guardrails, eval refs)
- Determinism: fix sampling params in evals; keep templates small and composable
- Reuse: central prompt registry and clear naming; avoid copy/paste divergence
- Observability: log input/output pairs with trace IDs, anonymized
- Safety: include explicit system guardrails and content policies in templates

Model management
- Record lineage: base model, adapters, fine-tune data hashes, hyperparams, commit SHAs
- Test sets: maintain golden sets for regression and adversarial red-team sets
- Evaluation: mix automatic metrics (BLEU, Rouge, BERTScore), rubric scoring, and human-in-loop spot checks
- Drift: monitor data and behavioral drift; alarm on KPI deltas and escalate
- Containment: enforce rate limits, cost budgets, and deterministic fallbacks
- Portability: abstract providers; support local and hosted models interchangeably

Data governance
- Data contracts, PII classification, retention policies, and consent tracking
- Synthetic data clearly labeled; provenance and license metadata stored with datasets

## DevSecOps checklist for AI workloads

Design and architecture
- Threat model LLM/agent misuse, prompt injection, data exfiltration, and tool abuse
- Define trust boundaries for tools and external APIs; use allowlists/denylists
- Choose safe defaults: non-privileged agents, least-privilege tokens, timeouts

Supply chain
- SBOM for models, prompts, datasets, and dependencies
- Pin model versions and provider endpoints; verify signatures when available
- Scan container images; lock registries; enforce provenance (SLSA >= 2)

Secrets and access
- Separate runtime vs training secrets; short-lived tokens; encrypted at rest/in transit
- Vault-managed keys; never commit credentials; policy-as-code for access

Safety and compliance
- Pre-deploy safety evals (toxicity, bias, hallucination rate, copyright)
- Red-team harness with up-to-date injection payloads; jailbreak detection
- Audit trails for prompts, datasets, model choices, and human approvals
- Regional residency, DP, HIPAA/GDPR alignment where applicable

Runtime controls
- Output filters, content moderation, and PII scrubbers
- Tool sandboxing, rate limiting, cost controls, circuit breakers
- Observability: traces, prompt IDs, model latency, token usage, cost per request

Incident response
- Rollback plan per artifact type; kill-switch for model endpoints
- Drift and abuse detection alerts; postmortem templates including model behavior notes

## Trending issue references for 2025

Use these topics as watchlists for backlog and risk reviews:
- Prompt injection via tool calling and function execution in agents
- Retrieval contamination: poisoned embeddings and indirect data exfiltration
- Hallucination reduction techniques: constrained decoding, self-consistency, verifier models
- Safety tax: balancing eval rigor vs. latency/cost in production
- Model routing and cost optimization under variable provider pricing
- Data locality and sovereign AI requirements (EU AI Act, global AI regulations)
- Copyright filters and license compliance for generated code and media
- Open weights vs SaaS models: hybrid strategies and fallbacks
- Evaluation standardization: GAIA, HELM-style scorecards, and task-specific harnesses
- Inference efficiency: speculative decoding, KV cache reuse, quantization-aware routing

## Quick start

- Fork this repo and enable GitHub Actions
- Copy sample workflows from /pipelines/.github/workflows
- Configure provider credentials with OpenID Connect and repo/environment secrets
- Add prompts in /ai/prompts and datasets in /ai/datasets with metadata
- Run evals locally with make eval or via CI; inspect scorecards in /ai/evaluations/results
- Gate deployments on eval thresholds and safety checks
